                <p>life is ever-lasting process of learning. We are always learning something new, facing new challenges. Every new day is a learning opporunity. We spend most of our life trying to learn but we never actually learn how to learn. So many hours have been wasted trying to reread a text, just to forget it a week later. Books have been highlighted red, just for it to fade away from our memory. In the end we convince ourselves that we are not meant for learning, we are not meant for education, and we give up on our ambitions. 
                    Today, a lot of research has been done about learning for it to tell us what works and what doesn't. it is about</p>
                <br><p>Today, a lot of research has been done about learning for it to tell us what works and what doesn't. it is about time that we adopt these new efficient methods of learning and make learning problems a thing of the past. In this article, I will try to tell you how to be the best learner and unlock your full potential. A few minutes trying to adopt these new techniques into your life can save you years of fruitless and exhaustive learning. </p>

                <h2>Before we get into how to learn, let's first learn about our brain and how to use it to its full potential</h2><br>
                <p>There are essentially two modes of thinking: Focused mode (Consious thinking) and Diffused mode (Sub-conscious thinking).</p>

                    <div class="type">
                        <h3>Focused mode</h3><br>
                        <p>Focused mode is when you are consciously giving your attention to the problem. For example: you trying to solve a maths problem during examination.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="type">
                        <h3>Diffused mode</h3><br>
                        <p>Mode of thinking when you are not consiously trying to think about the problem. for example: walking, showering, running.</p>

                <p>Being an expert at anything requires the use of both focused and diffused mode. When we are at focused mode, we have too narrowed vision to see anything beyond what we already know. We are unable 
                    to make new connections. Because of this we cannot get deeper into the subject. Our understanding becomes limited. Tackling this problem is easy. All we 
                    have to do is take a break. Do anything that relaxes you and do not think about the topic. Sub consciously, we will make different connections and when we go back to studying, we will have
                    a new perspective which will provide us fresh insights. Learning this way has two major advantages. First, your don't get tired very easily as you are taking constant breaks.
                    Second, you will have fresh and deep insights in the subject which increases your understanding of the topic. This makes it much more easier for you to
                    retain the information.

                    What works and what doesn't?
                </h2>
                <p>We are all familiar with those long hours spent cramming the whole book few days before the examination. By the time, we are done with the 
                    examination, we are also done with the knowledge. By next day, we will have forgotten 50% of what we read and next week, 100% of it. Why put so much effort just to forget it?
                    Examinations aren't about grades, it is about testing yourself on what you know and what you don't.
